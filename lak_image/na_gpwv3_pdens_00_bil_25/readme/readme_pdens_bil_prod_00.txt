ARCHIVE CONTENTS

The data contained in this archive are the final version of GPWv3, and
should be used instead of the previous (alpha, beta) versions.

This archive contains population densities, both UN-adjusted and unadjusted, 
in BIL format. The raster data are at 2.5 arc-minutes resolution and contain 
the following data:

ds00g	population densities in 2000, unadjusted, persons per square km
ds00ag	population densities in 2000, adjusted to match UN totals, persons per square km

All densities are in persons per square kilometer.

The BIL format is stores the data as binary files with associated 
information stored in world, header, and statistics files. The set 
of BIL files and what they contain are described below.

.bil	Binary format data

.blw	Resolution information with the following lines:
		resolution in x-dimension
		rotation factor (always zero for GPW)
		rotation factor (always zero for GPW)
		resolution in y-dimension
		x-coordinate of the center of the upper-left cell
		y-coordinate of the center of the upper-left cell

.hdr	Header file with the following lines:
		Byte order (motorola or intel, M or I)
		Layout (BIL or Band Interleaved by Line)
		NROWS (number of rows)
		NCOLS (number of columns)
		NBANDS (number of bands)
		NBITS (number of bits -- 4, 8, 24, or 32)
		BANDROWBYTES (number of byes per band, per row)
		TOTALROWBYES (total byes of data per row)
		BANDGAPBYTES (Does not apply for BIL)

.stx	Statistics of the grid before export, the grid statistics are stored
	on one line. Note that the values (listed below) are for the grid and therefore
	they exclude nodata. Conversion may set nodata areas to zero, which will 
	alter the statistics.
		Band (always one)
		Minimum value
		Maximum value
		Mean value
		Standard deviation

The data are stored in geographic coordinates of decimal degrees based 
on the World Geodetic System spheroid of 1984 (WGS84).
